## Purpose

The purpose of exploring water quality is to see if there is a link between that and health outcomes or burden. By looking at datasets from UNICEF, the IHME and WHO in addition to research papers gathered on the subject, we will investigate to find any patterns or insights between water quality and health outcomes. There are several things that we can narrow the scope of our focus on, including looking at different water sources (drinking water, surface water, water in schools to list some) or narrow by health metric. Some of the health areas we could focus on are child development, child mortality rate, maternal health, or general health burden. The amount of data available is rich so there doesnâ€™t appear to be a shortage of directions to take with this project. 


## Research


### Drinking Water in Sub-Saharan Africa

This article studied the impact on health that access to clean drinking water had on children in the sub-saharan African countries of Senegal, Chad, and Cameroon. It was found that a lack of access to clean drinking water resulted in higher risk of health burdens such as diarrhea. This study also noted that households who were further than 30 minutes from a clean water source, and households with lower living standards were at much higher risk of contracting diarrhea.

### Water in Rural China

This article investigated the effects of a water quality improvement project in rural China. The study used 4500 households over a time period of 17 years (1989 to 2006) and used metrics such as weight and height to measure the effectiveness of the program. The study found that improving access to higher quality water sources improved weight to height ratios, which is interpreted to mean the individuals health improved. 

### Heavy Metal in Drinking Water

[https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajest/article/view/93896](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajest/article/view/93896)

Heavy metal content in drinking water as one of the causes of health risks posed by drinking contaminated water. Drinking water quality has been one of the main determinants in assessing health quality worldwide. A major cause for concern is the presence of heavy metals in quantities exceeding those prescribed in international guidelines in many parts of the world. It is known that there are million people with chronic HM poisoning which has become a worldwide public health issue, while 1.6 million children die each year from diseases for which contaminated drinking water is a leading cause. Thus, research provides us with evidence that heavy metal contamination in drinking water can have adverse health effects on the health of the human population and effective measures need to be taken to ensure its removal from systems providing drinking water.


### Health inequalities by gradients of access to water and sanitation between countries in the Americas, 1990 and 2010

This research explores distributional inequality of key health outcomes as determined by access coverage to water and sanitation (WS) between countries in the Region of the Americas. Its result found access to water and sanitation correlated with survival and mortality, and strong gradients were in both 1990 and 2010. Higher WS access is corresponded to higher life expectancy and healthy life expectancy and lower infant and maternal mortality risks. 


## Data


### Clean Water Dataset

[https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/drinking-water/](https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/drinking-water/) 

The dataset we will be using for measuring the quality of water for each country was collected by WHO and UNICEF as part of their Joint Monitoring Programme. This data set is global, and includes information collected from almost every country. Collection of this dataset began in 1990. The Joint Monitoring Programme created this dataset by working with governments to set up systems which can gauge the water quality and sanitation levels of the country in standardized ways. 


### Health Burden Dataset

[http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2017](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2017) 

The dataset we will be using for measuring health burden was collected by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. This data set is global, and includes information collected from 195 countries in 2017. The GBD is composed of estimates for different health burdens and outcomes for each country. These estimates are based on a dataset that was created by aggregating over 9000 other datasets regarding health, some of which were made publically available through their country of origin. 


## Target Audience

Access to safe water is a fundamental need and basic human right, however, not all humans have the ability to access water. This project aims to recognize how safe water is important to our health, and how not everyone has the ability to access safe water. Our _target audience_ is individuals around the world, especially, individuals who can minimize inequality of accessing water. It is important to understand how safe water is a valuable resource for healthy life for everyone in the society. This analysis would help people to recognize helping others who cannot afford safe water. Understanding how social inequality can increase differences of water accessibility can expand access of safe water in the world. 


## Specific Questions



1. What health burdens cause the most impact on dalys at differing levels of access to clean water? How does access to clean water generally affect the overall health of a country?
2. Which demographic is affected the most due to inability to procure uncontaminated drinking water and needs access to its availability the most? Does geography/natural parameters affect the quality of drinking water?
3. Which region in the world is most affected by lack of access to clean and safe drinking water and needs the most immediate attention?


# Technical Description


## Project Format 

The format of our project will be a shiny app. We will provide a report which answers our specific questions, and then a tool for further investigating the dataset by region. 


## Data Challenges 

Cleaning the dataset regarding water and sanitation for analysis will be difficult. We will need to specifically identify what data is useful for us, and reshape it to be used with the Health Burden dataset.


## New Technical Skills

Relearning Shiny, and visualization of the dataset. 

Learning how to design a web app that conveys our report on population health effectively. 


## Major Challenges 

Deciding what kind of interactions would better allow users to better understand the importance of the data being presented and explore the visualizations.
